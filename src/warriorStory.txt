The battle rages in front of you. All you can see is carnage as the largest battle in history plays out. The air is heavy, clogged with the intense stench of blood. Another enemy in front of you, and who knows how many more. This one must have just gotten into manhood, his face is young and it looks like he can barely carry the armor he’s wearing. The boy half lunges, half stumbles at you with a sword thrust. As you dodge, you're able to turn and land your sword in the armor slit between the chestplate and helmet. Another useless death, another useless life thrown away.

As you look up again you’re able to see your childhood friend Darrell ahead of you. He seems to be fighting a formidable opponent, but nothing he can’t handle. You survey the massacre in front of you, acres of dead bodies, lives wasted. The battle isn’t leaning towards one side or the other, both sides are fighting tooth and nail, neither giving any ground. You see your general in the midst of the fray, taking on three at a time, inspiring the troops. Without him this battle would have been lost hours ago.

You keep looking for a place to help across the battlefield, and as you glance back at Darrell, you see him about to get surrounded. There's no doubt, only action as you spring to help your friend. As you rush over, to your horror you see an archer, along with their target, the general. You think you can take down the archer before he fires, but that would doom Darrell to death. Which do you choose?

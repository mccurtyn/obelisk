The battle rages in front of you. All you can see is carnage as the largest battle in history plays out. The air is heavy, clogged with the intense stench of blood. Another enemy in front of you, and who knows how many more. This one must have just gotten into manhood, his face is young and it looks like he can barely carry the armor he’s wearing.

You see your general in the midst of the fray, taking on three at a time, inspiring the troops. Without him this battle would have been lost hours ago.

Which do you choose?
